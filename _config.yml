    Hi, I'm Allen.
   I write about the metaphors that make us human along with the histories that produce them.   
   I'm a PhD candidate in Christianity in Antiquity at Fordham University. Right now: experimenting with online pedagogy.
   And writing a dissertation on blood and Christian theology in the second and third centuries.

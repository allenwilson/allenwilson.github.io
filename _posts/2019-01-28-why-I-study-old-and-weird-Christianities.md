 Why I study old and weird Christianities

Let's see if this works. I'm typing this out with some dictation because my fingers are sweating waiting on this sweltering platform for the D. 

Are there any Methodists who study and write about the history of Christianity?

And by that I don't mean Acts and Luther and then Wesley. I mean all of it. Especially the stuff between Acts and Luther. Critically that. 

The reason that I ask is because 
Increasingly in my time at Fordham I'm becoming aware of how my own historical situation as a Methodist from the south has oriented the questions that I ask of Christian history. 

Rubbing shoulders with my Catholic and Orthodox friends here, I have realized how different my questions are from theirs. 

Ultimately we are working toward similar ends - most of us, but the direction we come to these sources, the ways we engage with them, and the baggage we bring is so very different. 

By baggage I mean 
What we choose to elide
What we choose to ignore 
And what we choose to place at the center of our attention. 

Our assumptions 
Our exemplars 
And our enemies. 

So I'm interested in seeing how people who come from relatively similar orientations and upbringings as mine have approached these historical periods. 

My hunch is that the majority of Methodists 
If they have chosen to engage with Christian history
Have done so in New Testament studies. 

Their questions are of an almost archaeological  kind 
Getting at origins and inceptions. 

But I'm interested in what happens after 
As that is inevitably where we fall - 
We being not just Methodists or Christians but modern people in the West. 


Wherever you set your origin point -
Your beginning 
Your arche
It's usually before where you are right now. 

As this concerns the New Testament 
I'm less concerned with what IS this text 
As I am with what do we DO with it. 
Therefore I look at how different people have interpreted these texts over centuries. 
And it gets weird. 

And that unexpected weirdness is what is so compelling about it. 
Weird is not
The  ideal
Perfect 
And original. 
This ideal is ultimately the impossible. 

Weird is contextual 
Historical 
Contingent 
Personal 
Specific. Weird is the improbable 
And therefore it is possible. 

(Maybe my friends who read Zizek and Badiou will affirm the exact opposite of what I just said but they can leave their angst for the DMs)

The Christianity that I grew up in was awsome and challenging and supportive and nourishing. 


But
The Christianity that I grew up lacked a history. 
Which was fine for someone like me who was not often forced to face the particularity of his own way of being in the world. 

Until I did. 

Even still I found myself  living in a tension between my own human experience 

and an
Impossible impulse toward the ideal, the true, and the genuine. 
 
This Christianity that I grew up in was one that would always have to struggle against the ambiguous and genuine ideal that was set before it. 

And we surely prided ourselves in trying to strive for this ideal. 


Strive away. I don't fault my religious family their effort and intentions. 
Nevertheless we do know what they say about good intentions, right?

Aphorism be damned?


I think as I reflect on on it more I realize that many of us were/are just living various, sporadic, and manifold kinds of Christianities while asserting one, absolute lived experience - 

or at least one absolute Christian mode of being, practicing, praying, worshipping, voting? Etc. 


This is all not to say that I have started just imitating weird ancient Christian practices because I don't think that's the solution at all.  

I am saying that I've started to accept and understand my own weirdness in the weirdness of my weird community and make a practice of operating through this understanding of my own particularity - my own weirdness. 

And then I use that to learn from ancient Christians. And even slightly less ancient Christians. 


What do I mean by weird?
I mean historically particular?
What do I mean by historically particular...

Will this analogy work?

Evangelical Christians have this great habit of making a cookie and saying: hey isn't this the best cookie? In fact, it's chewy just like the early Christians used to make it. when in fact if you eat this cookie, it's not chewy at all. 

it's actually a bit crunchy and kind of burnt- let's not say burnt. It's not crispy, just a little toasty. 


(For sure there are some burnt inedible charcoal discs being served as warm and gooey out there, but I am just focusing on my own community). 

The fact that this cookie is indeed crunchy is not to say that it is defective from the holy and good truth that is the original chewy cookie. 

To be honest, I think a good cookie could use a little bit more time in the oven and I like some crunch to my cookie. 

 all I'm saying is don't give me a frisbee and tell me that it's a chewy chips ahoy. Own up to your baking.

We have to already know this right?
I think that deep down most of us evangelical Christians protestants Methodist whatever - most of us know that the cookie is a little crunchy. 

And then remember that maybe they weren't even eating cookies in the second century. 


So this is the struggle of this church that must struggle with its own failure again and again at achieving this absolute vision of what it ought to be
But probably never was.  


While at the same time it had to wrestle its own historically-situatedness - its own weirdness as an absolute 
Beyond history. As true. 
It's weirdness wasn't weird it was true. 
It's history wasn't history. It was truth. 

Please don't misunderstand me. 
As a Christian I believe that the incarnation does show us that truth is possible WITHIN history. 

But we have to understand history as history as first. That it is a place. And that truth takes place in it. 


As Methodists or Protestants or evangelical Christians
Our obsession with the New Testament is not ill-founded. But it does elide the space between its writing and our reading. 


It forgets the centuries, the histories, and the readings that produced us - that brought us back to the text in the first place. And this is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. 

I could wax on these dangers all day. And I intend to do so for years to come. It's basically what drives my teaching career - put career in parenthesis. Where are there even jobs? I'm freaking tweeting this. 

Anyway. 

But I want to return to my original question. Who else out there is like me? Who has gone before me? 

Who writes and speaks about the past with the same family of ghosts looking over there shoulder, both comforting them in their loneliness and also haunting their waking dreams?

# Research Workflow



Identify phases of the knowledge cycle:

1. Research

2. Read

3. Note

4. Write

   

The zettelkasten takes place in step 3 and the "in-between" of 4. The fourth category is slippery. Misconceptions about it throw up the most common road blocks to the flow of the knowledge cycle. 

In a way, each phase is not an object in and of itself. This is perhaps why they always feel incompleteâ€“ increasing anxiety.

I find that it helps instead to think about them as hinges between steps. They are not ends themselves. They are not stopping points but merely pass through points. In betweens on the way to your own thoughts. Incidentally they are your thougths, but you have to be coy with yourself to convince them to come out of their dens. 



Your writing session should aim to go through a form of each stage of the knowledge cycle:
    1. research
    2. read
    3. note
    4. write

Short circuits through this cycle ensure many repetitions and allow for breaks instead of burnout. The cycle also helps me understand the work to be done in more specific terms. Instead of "write x" or "work on x", I can point to a phase in the cycle. 



## Research

I need a shelf for books to read that I haven't read yet.

A stack of books that I am reading right now.

A stack of books that I have looked through but need to process into literary.

Digital parallels for these. I keep them in Zotero and export them to a Zotero folder in Dropbox. 

Take the notes together and store them together in a file with the bibliographic information in zotero. Then place the notes in the zettelkasten inbox so that you can now break up and process through the zettelkasten workflow. 



## Read

I have a lot of thoughts on what this entails. Too many to fit here now. I will link back to this later. 

Notes emerge from annotations that you happen to accrue while reading with a pencil in hand.

## Note 

Notes are produced from reading, but they have not yet been processed, thought-through, developed, connected, or separated from their original text. This is what the zettelkasten method is for. Notes that I first put into the zettelkasten, either manually or automatically by a workflow from drafts, I mark with the "inbox" tag. I use a "#" to mark tags.[^201901282224] 

[^201901282224]: For more on tags, see Appendix. tk link to drafts workflow.

This lets me know that the note needs to be processed and connected to other notes and structure notes. 
It also gathers all of these kinds of notes together in one place so I can batch this process. 

Processing notes in the inbox:

- Does the note make sense? Is it processed enough yet? Sometimes I am lazy and instead of a note, I have copied a quote or paragraph that I need to interpret. I also need to make sure the note has correct citations. 
- Once the note can stand on its own, copy the note link (or title of the file).
- Place it on at least one other note that is related.
- Then add it to an outline or structure note. At least one. If it does not fit on any current outline, then make a new one. 
      

This is how you feed your zettelkasten. Don't write notes in a vacuum, and don't drop them in the void. Every note must be connected to another note or form the basis for new connections. Write notes with an eye towards what you already have waiting in the zettelkasten. And always link a new note to another note in the zettelkasten. If the note is new and does not connect to anything, start a new outline for it. 

When you add something, ask how it relates to what you already have. Does it support what comes before it? Does it contradict? Does it add something new? What questions are brought up by the adding of this note? A lot of these thoughts can be included in the note or in comment blocks that you will be able to see in markdown but won't show up in the manuscript version of the zettel.

Structure notes or outlines are helpful to visualize complex structure all at once. With a structure note you don't have to depend on the tags to navigate. Mark some of the helpful tag points on the outline. 

I try not to depned all that much on thematic tags. The tags I use are designed to designate note states. Nevertheless, I will admit that tags can be helpful so that you don't always have to depend on the outline on the computer. The notes can think for themselves. The tags also permanently structure your notes for future projects in the way maps can't. Maps are temporary and individual.[^201901282301] 

[^201901282301]: This could be an argument for folgezettel, if you are so inclined. 


## Write (The In-between)
When an outline reaches a critical threshold of your interest (or a deadline presses),
create a project folder and link the folder path on the note containing the outline. 
This allows for a new layer of communication 
back-and-forth
between the drafts in teh project folder
and the outline note.
Now your work is to communicate between the project folder and the outline. 
it is important to notice, that I said here communication between outline and *project folder* rather than draft. You are still not trying to produce that pristine, singular draft. You're beginning to write in that direction, but your goal right now is to populate  the project folder with conceptual pieces of plain text files that are synthesizing the notes in your outline together. Each plain text file should be synthesizing a minimum of two at a time.
You can also work through one note in mutliple files to see the different angles of the idea.  




Definition of project-related notes: 
comments in the manuscript
snippets of drafts
reminders
to-do lists
draft itself 

Subtasks for project folder: open questions, connections to other notes which could be further elaborated upon. reminders to "review chapter" or follow editing diagnostic.





## Appendix - Glossary of Tags

_#inbox_ = not connected to other zetteln or outlines
_#buffer_ = chunks of texts that need to be broken down - unfinished notes or pre-zetteln - they are a buffer between temporary notes on text and permanent notes in zettelkasten
_#OQ_ = open questions
_#flag_ = open or critical areas to bring to my attention - distinguish from buffer
_#later_ - buffer notes that are not a priority - can be processed later

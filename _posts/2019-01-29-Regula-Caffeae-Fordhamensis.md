# Regula Caffeae Fordhamensis


L I S T E N  carefully, my child,
to your master's recipe,
and incline the ear of your heart.
Receive willingly and brew out effectively 
your loving barista's advice, 
that by the labor of obedience 
you may return to your reading 
from which you had departed by the sloth of disobedience. 



1. Place the filter in the percolator.
2. Rinse the paper with water [or suffer the evils of the taste of bleached paper!].
3. Use a spoon to press the button beneath the filter to drain the water into the kettle.
4. Toss the water into the sink.
5. Add four scoops of Maxwell House.
6. Pat the sides of the plastic which holds the filter so the grounds make a flat bed. 
7. Add water to tank. 4/5 of the way full [slightly more or slightly less for the discerning drinker].
8. Make sure everything is closed and the lid to the kettle is in place.
9. Press the "on" button. 


When the coffee is finished. Don't be too hasty to judge! Let the coffee cool for a minute, and remember to serve your community first. 
Some may find it slightly weak, but that is because they are used to absolute bitterness. The world does not have to be as cynical as that. 

You must devote careful attention to the brewing of the community coffee, just as you would care for the community. Do not overburden the community with your dry bitterness nor water down their vigor. Respect for both must be attended. 
For we know that coffee is just water that has not reached its full potential yet. 


Amen

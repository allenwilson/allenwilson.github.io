In the past I graduated from the University of Tennessee Knoxville, where I majored in Latin and minored in Greek and Religious Studies. I wrote some songs and recorded an album while I was there too. I then spent some time thinking and writing at Harvard Divinity School where I earned my Masters in Theological Studies. I am now pursuing a PhD in the History of Theology at Fordham University.

I drink coffee with Nikki Klein, my beautiful wife, while she tries to convince me to do adventurous things with our Boston Terrier, Pen. I always keep a kendama on hand. If I'm not playing kendama then I'm either translating ancient languages or looking for German dubs of One Piece or Arrested Development so that I can practice my German.

If you're interested in any of those things,

Let's talk.

## Analysis of External Evidence 


### καυχήσωμαι

Greek uncials: 𝕻46, ℵ, A, B 
Greek miniscules: 048, 33, 1739 co
Early versions: none
Church Fathers: Jerome




This reading attests either a first person singular aorist subjunctive middle passive verb or a first person singular future indicative middle passive verb. 
The root word is the deponent καυχάομαι and it means to speak aloud or to boast. 
Given that it follows a ἵνα, it is most likely a future in a purpose clause construction. 
The verb itself does not have an object, which makes it harder to distinguish between it and the alternative verbs in other readings. 
The rest of the Pauline corpus supports the use of this word where it appears a total of 36 times. We see it in the following passages:
Romans 2:17; Romans 2:23; Romans 5:2; Romans 5:3; Romans 5:11 ; 1 Corinthians 1:29 ; 1 Corinthians 1:31; 1 Corinthians 1:31; 1 Corinthians 3:21 ; 1 Corinthians 4:7; 1 Corinthians 13:3 ; 2 Corinthians 5:12 ; 2 Corinthians 7:14; 2 Corinthians 9:2; 2 Corinthians 10:8; 2 Corinthians 10:13; 2 Corinthians 10:15; 2 Corinthians 10:16; 2 Corinthians 10:17; 2 Corinthians 10:17; 2 Corinthians 11:12; 2 Corinthians 11:16; 2 Corinthians 11:18; 2 Corinthians 11:18; 2 Corinthians 11:30; 2 Corinthians 11:30; 2 Corinthians 12:1; 2 Corinthians 12:5; 2 Corinthians 12:5; 2 Corinthians 12:6; 2 Corinthians 12:9; Galatians 6:13; Galatians 6:14; Ephesians 2:9; Philippians 3:3; 2 Thessalonians 1:4;  

The sense of Paul handing over his body _so that [he] may boast_, however, is unclear. The sentence is syntactically acceptable, and the vocabulary is thoroughly supported.
Nevertheless, the phrase requires interpretation. 


### καυθησομαι 

Greek uncials: C, D, F, G, L
Greek miniscules: 6, 81, 104, 630, 945, 1175, 1881*
Early versions: latt, sy (marginal reading in the Harklensis)
Church Fathers: Tertullian, Ambrosiaster, Jerome

latt = the entire Latin tradition, with a few exceptions due to to intraversional differences, in support of the same reading


This reading attests a first person singular future indicative passive form of the verb καίω, which means "to kindle" or "to burn".
This verb appears nowhere else in the Pauline corpus, but it does appear in the gospels. 
While the vocabulary is unattested in Paul, the syntax of the purpose clause construction works well, and the phrase requires less interpretation. 
In this reading, Paul hands over his body _so that [it] may be burned_ as a sacrifice. The overall sense of sacrificing ones' own body is attested elsewhere in Paul. 
See, for example, Romans 12:1-2. 


### καυθησωμαι

Greek uncials: K, ψ, 𝕸
Greek miniscules: 365, 1241, 1739, 1881, 2464
Early versions:  none
Church Fathers: none

  

This reading attests to a first person singular aorist subjunctive middle passive form of the verb καίω, which means "to kindle" or "to burn".
The aorist subjunctive makes sense of the aorist subjunctive παραδῶ in the protasis. 
The aorist subjunctive in the protasis puts the clause in secondary sequence where an aorist subjunctive with ἵνα can function like an optative. 
It narrates an intention in the past. Thus, καυθησωμαι explains the intention behind the "handing over" in a contrary to fact condition. 
As stated above, the verb  καίω does not appear anywhere else in Paul.



### καυθη = καυθῇ

Greek uncials: none
Greek miniscules: 1505
Early Versions: sy (supported reading in the Harklensis)

This reading attests a third person singular aorist subjunctive passive form of the verb καίω, which means "to kindle" or "to burn".
The use of the third person singular here distinguishes Paul from his body, which makes more syntactical sense given that if something is to be burned, it most likely the antecedent τὸ σῶμά. 
Here too, as above, the aorist subjunctive makes sense for the same reasons. 


Also as stated above, the verb  καίω does not appear anywhere else in Paul.
 


## Analysis of External Evidence

In terms of the external evidence, καυθησομαι holds the greatest number of witnesses, far out weighing the other alternative in every form of attestation.
καυχήσωμαι comes in second, with the other two alternatives having the weakest attestation.
It is also worth noting that all the alternatives are alternate versions of the same root word καίω. 
I think this gives an even stronger case for reading καυθησομαι instead of καυχήσωμαι. 


## Analysis of Internal Evidence

Syntactically, each of these words can work. 
The heavily attested καυχήσωμαι and καυθησομαι both fit easily into a common ἵνα clause construction. 
Alternatively, καυθησωμαι and καυθῇ make sense of the use of the aorist subjunctive παραδῶ. 
Further, the reading of "to be burned" also more easily explains the intentions of the παραδῶ. 
καυχήσωμαι is confusing. Boast about what? Why would he boast? 
The absence of καίω from the rest of the Pauline corpus should give us pause, whereas καυχάομαι is everywhere throughout.   
The matter comes down to hapax legomenon versus lectio difficilior. 
For this reason, I think the lectio difficilior of καυχήσωμαι is the right choice, and if I could conjecture then I would look to the high attestation of καυθησωμαι in other manuscripts as scribal attempts to wrestle with and interpret this more difficult reading.
